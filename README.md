Stylus Utils
============

`reset.styl`
-------------
Theoretically, this file should be imported as-is and not edited on a per-project basis.
It’s split in two parts: **reset** and **utils**. These are pretty self-explanatory.


`styles.styl-sample`
---------------------
Starting point for a project’s main stylesheet. Contains placeholder selectors and rules with default values, meant to be overridden.
Just `mv styles.styl-sample ../styles.styl` out of the submodule folder and style away!
